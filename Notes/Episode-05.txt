React is fast beacuase react fast in DOM manupilation and doing efficient DOM manupilation beacuase it ha Virtual DOM.
React efficiently find out the difference between virtual DOMs and update the UI.

Hooks-
    - A normal JS function which is given to us by react.
    - Its a prebuild the only thing is that function comes with superpower, it has logic written behind the scene inside React.
    - This function is a utility function given by react to us.
    - Hooks import as a Named import type

    useState()-
        - It is a Super powerfull variable.
        - It is used to create state variable.
        - It maintain the state of our component.
        - Keep the UI in sync with data.
        - A local state variable scope is inside the component.
        - Whenever a state variable react re-rendered the component.
        - As soon data changes react re-rendered component.

React using Reconciliation Algorithm also known as React Fiber.
The “reconciliation” algorithm in React is how the decision to re-render the component is made.
    - It watches closely for differences, and only updates the DOM when necessary and tries to update only the parts which need to be changed.
    - The reconciliation algorithm is run whenever the component level state is updated.

Virtual DOM is not an actual DOM.
    - It is representation of an actual DOM.
    - It is just a javascript object and javascript representation of HTML code.
    - Diff Algorithm finds out the diff between two virtual DOM the updated virtual DOM and the previous virtual DOM.
    - Once it find out diff between old DOM and new DOM then it will update in actual DOM.
    - Whenever there is a change in any state variable react will find out  the diff between virtual DOM and it will re-render our component or it will update the actual DOM.
