Planning to build an App.

Props: 
    Passing a props to a component is just like passing a argument to a function.
    Props are just normal arguments to a function.
    Prop is an object.
    Its pass to a component.
    React will take all properties whch pass in component and it will wrap inside an object and it will pass as a props in aurgument.
    When you have to dynamically passing some data to a component you pass in as a props.
