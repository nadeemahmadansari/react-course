Monolithic Architecture
    - In this architecture it bound UI, backend, databse in one project.
    - When making change in UI we need todeploy the whole project

Microservice Architecture
    - A microservices architecture, also simply known as microservices, is an architectural method that relies on a series of independently deployable services.
    - It can connect with UI, backend, DB other services by /PATH_NAME.

Two approaches of how UI applications fetch the data from backened
    1- As soon as our page load we can make API call wait for data to come and then we render the data
    2- As soon as the page load we will just render UI now we will make API call as soon as we get data now we will render the data

    Second approach is better and give the better UX beacuase user does not see any lag and random stuff.

React render cycle is very fast, React render our UI very Fast

UseEffect -  useEffect callback function will be called after our component renderes 

CORS - Cross Origin Resource sharing
    It is a mechanism which uses additional HTTP headers to tell the browser whether a specific webapp can share resource with another webapp but that both the webapp should have different origin.

Why do we even need state variable?
    - It will re-render the component.
    - It will change the default value and re-render the component.
    - When we change state variable value it will create new virtaul DOM and compare the new virtual DOM with old virtual DOM and render the component.
    - Whenever state variable update react trigger a reconciliation cycle(re-render the component)
